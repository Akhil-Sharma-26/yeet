### Notice: 
This has not been fully tested on Windows yet, so if you are using Windows and have found some issues, please give me feedback. :)
I am using the filesystem library to make it cross-platform.

# Introduction:
- This is a project to make my own version control with some improvements.
- Through this, I also want to learn the backend of version control and make my grasp stronger on C++.
- I am trying to solve some of my personal problems and gain an understanding of the Computer filesystem and its management.

## HOW TO USE IN LINUX/UNIX ENVIRONMENT
1. Clone/Download this repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this directory.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
 g++ main.cpp controllers.cpp -std=c++17 -lcryptopp -lz -o yeet
```
4. Set the permissions for the executable file:
```bash
chmod a+x yeet
```
5. Set the environment variable:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/yeet/repo/
```
6. Run the executable file and initialize an empty yeet repo:
```bash
yeet init .
```
## Make Sure:
you have lcryptopp installed in your system. I am using fedora and I installed it using:
```bash 
sudo dnf install cryptopp-devel
```
Search according to your OS.

## CAREFUL
- For now, You can only make git init in the pwd, You can not do git init /home/abc/some/folder. This will not work. It will be executed but will give rise to complications. If you want to init in a folder, you have to cd to that folder and then run the command. 
- You can only yeet init in a already made directory. You can not yeet init in a directory that does not exist.
- There is no option to base/rebase for the branch/checkout command

## Workflow diagrams:
The below are very minimal and abstracted view of the working of the project. You have to go throught the code to learn the details of the implementation.

## Testing The compression:
Use the Testing_inflating.cpp file as follow for decompressing your blob data: 
```bash
g++ -lz Testing_Inflating.cpp -o Testing_inflate && ./Testing_inflate
```

You can also use the following command:
```bash 
zlib-flate -uncompress < .yeet/objects/5d/8d5a1314ec0f6a5b7f8ac27dfbf53ed82bf3fe > test-abc
```

## Main Compilation Command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp controllers.cpp -std=c++17 -lcryptopp -lz -o yeet
```

## FOR BETTER DEBUGGING:
```bash
g++ main.cpp controllers.cpp -std=c++17 -lcryptopp -lz -fdiagnostics-all-candidates
```

## COMMENTS/TODOs:
- For now, I am leaving the locks and while writting and reading file. It might cause error at some cases.
- No structure Error handling for now.
- Temparary Path approach for storing objects will do it later.
- Back traversal for full history tree, will work on it next.
- More robust Testing is needed. (Trying to implement it using GoogleTests.)

## Branch:
[x] Branch Creation
[x] Current Branch storage
[x] Changing Branches (Checkout)
[x] See all branches with commit ids
[x] Commits on the active branch.
[ ] Option to choose which branch I want to make my new branch from. (Currently the new branch will automatically start from the prev branch ie the branch you were in)

## Checkout:
[ ]logic to reset the working directory to the target branchâ€™s commit using tree traversal.

## Commit:
[ ] Commits should check the diifs function output to check what are the files in which changes are made. (Find solution of the problem: what if branches are changed? then how to this?)

## Status:
[x] Status function is not working at edge cases. (Not parsing exec was the problem)
[ ] Design a new file structure `.diff` to store the diffs content
